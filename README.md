<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Originally, this was supposed to be an ecrypted messaging application where the messages would be encrypted before being send over the server however, I ran into issues trying to convert the encrypted messages into a string so I had to remove that from this project. Although, this is something that I'd like to work back on in the near future. This project is a messaging application on the desktop like other social messaging applications like skype and discord however, the messages would be stored on the users PC instead of on a server permanently. This was made as I wanted to learn how users were able to message someone over the internet using sockets and also used some knowledge on multithreading which I took a course in during university to create this application. It is noted that messages are stored temporarily on the server but the messages will be deleted once the receiver has logged on to retrieve those messages.
